# D2G-Aufgaben-Demo

Deploy-to-Grading (D2G) is a toolchain for automated analysis and grading of
programming tasks. This repository contains a demo assignment that can be used
to test the D2G pipeline. For more information on D2G, take a look the
[D2G repository](https://github.com/Programmiermethoden-CampusMinden/Deploy-to-Grading).

## How to demo

To test the D2G demo, create a fork of the repository in your own namespace.
Then create a new branch in that repository and start solving the tasks. Each
task is in its own folder (Note: The `empty` task is only a template for
creating your own tasks). When you completes the tasks, start a pull request
that merges your solution into your `master` branch. This will automatically
start the D2G pipeline as a Github workflow. You can view your results by
opening the console output of the workflow.
